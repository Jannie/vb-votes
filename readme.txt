Description:
------------

vBulletin addon. Add voting buttons to each post. Looks similar to thanks/groan mods,
but optimised for high loads. That's make a serious differences for big forums.
Contains votes convertor, if you wish to migrate from thanks/groan.

Features:

1. Very high speed.

2. DB designed to easily extend voting to social groups and articles.

3. Allows to completely hide mod from guests, to improve SEO.

Issues:

1. Doesn't filter forums in search results. That's a tradeoff for speed.
   So, DON'T enable mod in private forums. Add those to exclude settings.
